# Metabolic Model of Syntrophy for Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough and Methanococcus maripaludis
iSI1283 - Syntrophic community model generated by integrating genome-scale metabolic network models of Dv and Mm. iJF744 model of DvH and iMR539 model of Mm were integrated into a syntrophy community model

# Curation
The syntrophy metabolic model (iSI1283) was improved for its proportionate predictions of hydrogen production from lactate by curating the model reactions related to iJF744 reconstruction. This step was performed by analyzing the iSI1283 model for its elemental balance for key metabolites including reduced ferredoxin (cpd11620[c]), oxidized ferredoxin (cpd11621[c]), Menaquinol (cpd15499[c]), Menaquinone (cpd15500[c]), reduced DsrC (cpd18072[c]), oxidized DsrC (cpd18073[c]).

Please refer to the manuscript's supplementary information for details on all the curation steps.
